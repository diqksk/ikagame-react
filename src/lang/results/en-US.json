For his own purpose, he seems cold-blooded, whether pickpocket or murder, but he is actually described as a person who is soft-hearted and knows how to do for others.

He holds Ki Hoon, who was almost eliminated from the first game, with one hand and saves him, showing that he takes care of the safety of others as much as his own. It also suggests that he has strong power, such as swinging steel frames in tug-of-war games.

Through an internal communication with the staff, we siphoned off the losers to extract organs and made a deal to receive hints and food for the next game in return. In order to join the Deoksu team, he only informs Deoksu of the information on the next game and made Deoksu abandon Beauty.

If this person goes to the army, he is more likely to have gone to commandos or marines than to the general army.

If you are caught by an organization anyway, even if you kill all people in the game, you will win the game and solve all the problems. It not only throws out Hanmi-nyeo, who promised to be together in the previous game, in the next game without hesitation, but also brutally assaults and kills those who protested in a set distribution.

With his unique observation and judgment, he infers the relationship with his brother by looking at the business card Sung Ki-hoon left at the police station. He disguised himself as an agent and almost broke in and was discovered several times, but he showed his calmness and covered up the situation. His ability to achieve his goals is outstanding, such as searching the island through various knowledge he gained while working as a police officer and eventually finding information about his brother.
